    <h1>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</h1>
    <h2>And then the battle's not so bad? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Then we'll go with that data file! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.</h2>
        <p>Bender, quit destroying the universe! This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
            <br>
            Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! I never loved you. It's toe-tappingly <strong>tragic</strong>! Noooooo!
